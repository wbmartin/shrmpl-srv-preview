## 🚀 Why Shrmpl?

Tired of spinning up Docker containers for simple services? Frustrated with complex configuration just to run Redis locally? **Shrmpl** provides tiny, single-binary replacements for the infrastructure you actually need.

**No containers. No complex setup. Just run it.**

---

## 📦 Current Components

### 🔑 shrmpl-kv
**Redis replacement** - In-memory key-value store with Redis-compatible protocol

```bash
# Start server
./shrmpl-kv-srv

# Use client
./shrmpl-kv-cli SET mykey myvalue
./shrmpl-kv-cli GET mykey
# → myvalue
```

**Features:** GET, SET, INCR, DEL, PING • 3-5 client support • 50-char limits • TCP persistence

---

### 📝 shrmpl-log  
**ELK/Splunk replacement** - Simple TCP log aggregation and daily rotation

<img src="doc/img/shrmpl-log.png" alt="shrmpl-log logo" width="120"/>

```bash
# Start log server
./shrmpl-log-srv

# Logs automatically rotate:
# activity-20251105.log  (ACTV level)
# error-20251105.log    (ERRO level)  
# misc-20251105.log      (everything else)
```

**Features:** Fixed-width protocol • Built-in stats • Minimal dependencies • File-based storage

---

### 🔐 shrmpl-vault
**HashiCorp Vault replacement** - Secure config/secrets management with HTTPS/mTLS

<img src="doc/img/shrmpl-vault.png" alt="shrmpl-vault logo" width="120"/>

```bash
# Start vault server
./shrmpl-vault-srv

# Retrieve config securely
curl -k "https://localhost:7474/my-config?secret=dev-secret-key"
```

**Features:** HTTPS/mTLS • Rate limiting • File-based storage • Certificate management

---

### 🔄 shrmpl-cicd
**CI/CD webhook runner** - Receives webhooks and executes deployment scripts

```bash
# Start CICD server
./shrmpl-cicd-srv etc/shrmpl-cicd-srv-loc.env

# Trigger via webhook
curl -X POST -H "X-Hook-Secret: my-secret" http://localhost:8080/hook/deadbeef
```

**Features:** GitHub/Azure DevOps/generic webhooks • HMAC validation • Script execution with timeout • Slack notifications • Deduplication

---

### 🔔 shrmpl-nackmon
**Negative acknowledgment monitor** - Watches for scheduled check-ins, alerts on misses

```bash
# Start nackmon server
./shrmpl-nackmon-srv etc/shrmpl-nackmon-srv-loc.env

# Services check in after completing their work
curl http://localhost:7575/checkin?code=BKUP2024
```

**Features:** Cron-based scheduling • Configurable wait windows • Slack alerts with escalation • GUID-protected status endpoint
